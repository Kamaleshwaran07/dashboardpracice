## Browser Router

We are using the **Browser Router**  from the **React Router v6** library to navigate from one page to another in a single page application without rerendering the component.

This improves the overall performance of the app.

## Data

To display the information in a card the json data is created using [json Data AI](https://www.jsondataai.com/).

## Navtitles

To display the data relating to the page I used filter method  in JavaScript with head as a parameter

``` <DS data={data.filter((item) => item.head === "Data Science")} /> ```

After getting the filtered data from the **Navtitles Component** to the required component, I tried to replicate as it is in [*guvi.in/blog*](https://www.guvi.in/blog). But I didnt bring the Navlinks into center of the page and context on top of it.

After the task submission, I will work on it..

Thank You!!!
